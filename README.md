Goal: Create a crossplatform library to transfer a [fdroid] [Repo-Catalog] (= FDroid Json Catalog
data) to Database

* Datasource (platform neutral): java jar data file [index-v1.jar] that contains zip-compressed data
  in fdroid-v1-json format
* Destination Database (platform specific):
    * Platfrom neutral Java Repository Interface with pojo-entities to be persisted in database
    * Anrdoid-Room Database Repository interface dao-implementation
    * J2SE-JPA Database Repository Interface Implementation
* V1UpdateService(platform neutral)

[fdroid-v1] - [JSON] format of one [index-v1.jar] / [index-v1.json] [Repo-Catalog] file

* Catalog
    * [Repo] (Example: address="https://f-droid.org/repo")
        * [Mirror]s (Example "https://ftp.fau.de/fdroid/repo")
    * [App]s (Example [packageName]="com.chancehorizon.just24hoursplus")
        * [Category]s (Example "Games")
        * [Localized] (Example: "en-US" -> summary="Large digital clock in 24 hour format")
    * [Package]s (Example packageName="com.chancehorizon.just24hoursplus")
        * [Version]s (Example versionName="1.4.1")

Database format

* [Repo]
    * [App]s
        * [Category]s

Architecture (high level, Modul)

* app (android)
    * fdroid-domain
    * fdroid-v1
    * fdroid-repository-android
* demo (spring-boot-cli)
    * fdroid-domain
    * fdroid-v1

Architecture (detailed)

* Userinterface out of scope: This work tries to esablish a platform independant service
  architecture in the fdroid ecosystem.
* Services (non-Android Code that uses other Services und Repository-Interfaces)
    * V1UpdateService Reads reads Android Catalog json data [fdroid-v1] and updates the Database via
      XxxxxxRepositories

> > * FDroidCatalogJsonStreamParserXxxx : reads Android Catalog json data [fdroid-v1] as a Stream of Events: on[Repo], on[App], on[Version]
          * XxxxUpdateService : translates [fdroid-v1] to database updates via XxxxRepository: [Repo]UpdateService, [App]UpdateService, [App]UpdateService, ...
      !!  * CanonicalLocale: Merges [Localized] to non-locale-languages: i.e. en, en-AU, en-GB, en-US, en-rUS, en-us and en_US will all be mapped to "en"
      ??  * LocaleImportFilter : Filter out languages that the user does not understand and that is not stored in the local database to save memory.       * Example: I can read de, en, nds, nl but not ja, cn, ar, ...... ??  * [Repo]SecurityService: Make shure that catalogdata [index-v1.jar] is not tampered with (checksum and signature is ok)
      ??* DeviceCompatibilitySearchFilter:
          * If i have a Android-5 device and the software requires Android-6 or later     * If i have installed an [App] from [Repo] f-droid.org i cannot install an update[Version] from [Repo] f-droid.org because the [App]-[Version]-signature does not match. ??* [App]-[Category]-SearchFilter/Sorter:
          * show [App]s that match one or more [Category]s: Example I want to see [App]s of [Category] "games"
      ??* FulltextSearchFilter over [Packagename] and [Localized]- name, summary, description, whatIsNew of all languages the user understands. ??* RelevanceSorter: Relevance in app-title is higher than app-summay than app-description.     * Example when i search for "FDroid" i want to see the FDroid-Client-app before apps that contain "Available for download in FDroid. ??* LastUpdateSorter/Filter: Which app was updated in the last 90 days? ??* LanguageFilter:
          * app that has a translated catalog summary/description in one or more languages.     * the app-userinterface has been translated in one or more languages. ??* App-Rating/App-Comments (FDroid.org independant)
      ??* Userdefined Software collection and Software-Categories (FDroid.org independant)
      ??* Android-Specific app-Installation/Update/Deinstallation-Service

* Repository-Interface (database abstraction) with implementatino in Android-Room (XxxxxDao) and
  Spring-Boot-JPA XxxxRepositoryJpa + XxxxRepositoryAdapter
    * [Repo]Repository with [Repo]Dao and Spring-Boot-JPA [Repo]RepositoryJpa + [Repo]
      RepositoryAdapter,
    * [App]Repository with ...
    * [Localized]Repository with ...
    * [Version]Repository with ...

Software Moduls

* app (Android)
    * data_v1 (java based pojos with gson-json reader)
    * data_db (java Repository-interfaces, entity-pojos, import services)
        * repository-interfaces implemented with Android-Room

* demo (non android, based on spring-boot)
    * data_v1 (java based pojos with gson-json reader)
    * data_db (java Repository-interfaces, entity-pojos, import services)
        * interfaces implemented with non-Android-jpa
        * fake-room-annotation-jar

Database Differences between Android-Room and j2se-jpa

* Room-Entities don't allow object references
    *
    see https://developer.android.com/training/data-storage/room/referencing-data#understand-no-object-references
    * only primitive types, primarykeys and foreinkeys are allowed in entities. No List<Xxx> or
      Object references.
    * Model navigation: instead of using entity members (List<Xxx> or Object references) you must
      use repository methods
* room-annotations are inside android-modules that cannot be used inside non-android-libs
    * workaround create a non-android-lib with code duplicates of the room-annotations
* room-dao findAll (T[] or List<T>) and jpa findAll (Iterable<T>) are not compatible: different
  return types
* room-dao uses insert(T) or update(T); JPA uses save(T)
* annotation namespace: androidx.room.* vs javax.persistence.*
