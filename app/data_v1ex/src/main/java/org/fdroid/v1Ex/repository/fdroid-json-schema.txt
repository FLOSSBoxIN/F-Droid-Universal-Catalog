Is there a JSON Schema for F-Droid repository data "index-v1.json" that is inside https://f-droid.org/repo/index-v2.jar ?

I want to generate java code that can read the catalog https://f-droid.org/repo/index-v2.jar.

I tried https://www.jsonschema2pojo.org/ to generate java from a short json example containing 2 apps and 2 packages.
The codegenerator generates one java class for every included app which is not what i want.

I found https://forum.f-droid.org/t/json-schema-for-f-droid-data-metadata-files-is-now-available/14079 but this info points to
Schema for an app description of an app and not to a schema of the catalog.

I want to generate


 metadata files is now available

## What did you do? (clear steps if possible)

I want to create a java program that can read/write the f-droid app catalog using a codegenerator like https://www.jsonschema2pojo.org/ that generates typed classes for App, Package, Locale, ...

## What did you expect to see?

Json that is compatible to json-schema like


       [{"locale":"de", "summary": "Gro\u00dfe Digitaluhr im 24-Stunden-Format"},
        {"locale":"en-US","summary": "Large digital clock in 24 hour format"}]

## What did you see instead?

valid json that is not compatible with json-schema (below json-apps)

            "localized": {
                "de": {
                    "summary": "Gro\u00dfe Digitaluhr im 24-Stunden-Format"
                },
                "en-US": {
                    "summary": "Large digital clock in 24 hour format"
                }
            }
